<p align="center">Classic snake game.</p>

### 🎯 How to play
- Go to the [game url](https://snake-hsemo.w3spaces.com) and start playing. You can move the snake around
via the `arrow_keys`. Every time your score becomes a multiple of 10 the
speed of the snake will increase and when the snake bites itself it's
game over. To play again after the game is over you have to refresh the page.

OR

- If you want to play locally then clone this repo with `git clone "https://github.com/hsemo/snake_game.git"`
command and open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

### ☑️ TODO
- Play again or replay feature
- Game over indicator
- Making the snake and board more beautifull
